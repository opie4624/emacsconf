@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

ENWC is the Emacs Network Client.  It uses several backends to allow the user to control network connections through GNU Emacs, while still allowing control to remain with the actual network manager.  ENWC makes uses of the D-Bus interfaces provided by these network managers.

@node Setup
@chapter Setup

First, the path to ENWC must be added to the @var{load-path} variable.  Then, in the @file{.emacs} file, the following must be added:

@lisp
(require 'enwc-setup)
(enwc-setup)
@end lisp

Now, simply press @kbd{M+x}, and type @kbd{ENWC}, and press @kbd{RET}.  ENWC will begin scanning for networks on the wireless interface, and display them in its buffer.

@bye
